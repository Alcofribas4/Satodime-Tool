Satodime primer
===============

What is Satodime?
-----------------------------

Satodime is a smartcard that stores cryptographic keypairs securely in a secure chip (also called Secure Element). 
Each keypair can be associated with a specific address on a blockchain. 

Each keypair is generated inside the secure chip and can be in any one of 3 states at any time:
	- uninitialized: the keypair has not been generated yet
	- sealed: the keypair has been generated securely inside the chip
	- unsealed: the private key has been revealed

Since the private key is generated inside the secure chip, a Satodime bearer can be certain that nobody (including himself) knows the private key until the key is unsealed.
In effect, a Satodime allows to physically transfer cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin from one person to another, without having to trust the bearer of the Satodime, AS LONG AS THE KEY IS IN THE SEALED STATE.

Depending on the model, from 1 up to 3 keypairs can be stored simultaneously on a single Satodime.

SatodimeTool overview
------------------------------------

When the SatodimeTool is launched, it actively looks for Satodime cards on all available interfaces.
Once a Satodime card is detected, the SatodimeTool initiates a connections and checks the authenticity of the cards, the results of this check is shown in the main window in the 'card status' field. If an issue arises with the card, more details are provided by clicking on the 'Details' button.

Below the 'Card info' tab, the status and info of each keyslot is provided. Remember that a Satodime can have up to 3 available keyslots, and each keyslot can be in the 'Uninitialized', 'Sealed' or 'Unsealed' state.
If a keyslot is sealed or unsealed, more details are provided by clicking on the 'More details' button for the corresponding slot. Available info includes the asset type, the blockchain used and the balance available for the associated address.

In a newly issued Satodime card, all the keyslots are in the 'Uninitialized' state, which means that the corresponding private keys have not been generated yet. You can seal a keyslot by clicking on the 'Seal' button: a pop-up menu appears which allows to define the characteristics of the generated key, including the type of asset to store (a coin, a token or a NFT), the blockchain used (such as BTC, ETH,...) and if applicable the contract address (for token and NFT) and tokenID (for Non-Fungible Tokens). Once confirmed, the private-public keypair is generated and corresponding address is shown in the main menu.

For a given keyslot, the transition between status follows always the same cycle: 'Uninitialized' => 'Sealed' => 'Unsealed' => 'Uninitialized' => ...
Different keyslots on the same Satodime are completely unrelated and can have different status at any given time.

When a keyslot is unsealed, the private key is made available to the user and can be recovered by clicking on the 'more details' button of the corresponding slot. Once the private key is unsealed, it is no longer protected by the secure chip and any asset associated with the corresponding address should be transferred immediately to a new address. This is generally done by 'sweeping' the private key and many wallet provides this option (e.g. Electrum and Metamask). YOU SHOULD NEVER ACCEPT A SATODIME FROM SOMEONE IF A KEYSLOT IS UNSEALED!

Once a keyslot is unsealed and any asset has been transferred, you can reset the slot to return it in its 'Uninitialized' state and start a new cycle again.

Satodime security features
-----------------------------------------

- Satodime authenticity: 
The Satodime includes a cryptographic mechanism that allows to check whether the card is an authentic Satodime or a fake one. If the card is not authenticated, you should be extremely careful and avoid to store any valuable on it. The authentication mechanism is based on a unique digital certificate issued for each authentic Satodime and verified with a trusted Public Key Infrastructure.

- Secure key generation: 
Private/public keypairs stored on the Satodime are always generated randomly inside the secure chip. As long as the keyslot is sealed, nobody has access to the private key. To prove that the private keys were not pre-generated during manufacturing and that no backdoor was inserted in the firmware, the user is prompted for a 64-hex random value during the sealing process. This random input is used to provide entropy during the key generation process. When the keyslot is unsealed and the private key is revealed, the entropy data (including user input) is provided and allows to ensure that the key generation process was indeed random.

- Transfer of ownership protection:
Satodime (and the SatodimeTool) supports communication through 2 interfaces: the NFC (Near Field Communication)  wireless interface and the wired interface through a standard smartcard reader.
It is important to note that the behavior of the Satodime is slightly different according to the interface used: the wired interface is considered 'trusted' while the NFC is not. In practice, this means that anyone can perform any operation via the wired (trusted) interface, while some sensitive operations can only be performed via the NFC interface by the legitimate owner. Sensitive operations include all operations that change the state of a keyslot (such as unsealing). This ensures that the current owner of a Satodime can confidently let a potential acquirer scan the card on his own device (e.g. to check the available balance) without the risk of unsealing and sweeping a private key.
To distinguish the legitimate owner of the card from other users, a pairing process is initiated when the card is transfered to a new owner. To initiate this transfer, the former owner simply click on the 'Transfer card' button in the 'Card info' tab in the main menu. Immediatly after, the card should be disconnected and provided the new owner to initiate new pairing. A message is then shown to confirm that a new pairing has been successfully established with the new owner through the SatodimeTool. If the transfer of ownership has not been initiated by the previous owner, the new owner SHOULD perform this transfer as soon as possible. The procedure is the same, except that in this case, it MUST be done via the 'trusted' wired interface (since pairing is a sensitive operation and it can only be done via the NFC interface by the legitimate owner).

External APIs
-----------------------
In order to recover the balance associated with an address, SatodimeTool uses several external services through web APIs.
The following info is sent to external server for this purpose only:
	- Address
	- Contract address (for tokens & NFTs)
	- API key (if required by a service such as etherscan.io)

The following external services are used:
	- blockstream.info (BTC)
	- fullstack.cash (BCH)
	- blockchain.com (BCH)
	- etherscan.io (ETH)
	- ethplorer.io (ETH)
	- blockscout.com (ETC, xDAI, RSK)
	- bscscan.com (BSC)
	- chain.so (LTC, DOGE, DASH)
